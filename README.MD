# NodeJS Todo App

My first NodeJS 'Todo' App.

### Installation of Required NodeJS packages

Enter the following commands in the command line:
````
npm install
````

### Create A Database

Replace the connection URL
````
mongoose.connect('mongodb://XXXX:XXXX@XXXX.mlab.com:XXXX/XXXX');
````
with your own MongoDB URL.

The schema of the MongoDB should be same as schema declared in "todoSchema".
